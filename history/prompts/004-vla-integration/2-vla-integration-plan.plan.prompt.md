# Prompt History Record: VLA Integration Planning

## Prompt Text

plz create and do working related to plan on D:\Suleman\spec_driven_ai\Hackathon1\my_latest_robotics_book\specs\004-vla-integration

## Response Text

Completed comprehensive planning for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration module. Created implementation plan, research document, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts. The plan covers the technical architecture for integrating voice input, natural language processing, and robotic action execution for humanoid robots using OpenAI Whisper, ROS 2, and cognitive planning components.

## Outcome

Planning phase completed with all required artifacts created:
- Implementation plan (plan.md)
- Research findings (research.md)
- Data model specification (data-model.md)
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md)
- API contracts (contracts/vla-api-contract.md)

Ready to proceed to task generation phase.
