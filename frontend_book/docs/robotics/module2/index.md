# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the robotics curriculum, where we explore digital twin simulation using Gazebo and Unity. This module focuses on physics-based simulation and environment modeling for humanoid robots, providing students with hands-on experience in creating realistic simulation environments.

## Overview

This module is designed for AI and robotics students with basic ROS 2 knowledge. You'll learn about:

- **Simulation Fundamentals**: Understanding physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- **Virtual Environments**: Building and interacting with environments in Unity
- **Sensor Simulation**: Working with LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 concepts
- Understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Familiarity with Linux command line (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Configure and run physics-based simulations in Gazebo
2. Create virtual environments in Unity for robot training scenarios
3. Implement and work with simulated sensors for robot perception
4. Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 systems
5. Validate simulation results against real-world expectations
