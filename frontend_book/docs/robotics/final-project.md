# Final Project: Complete Humanoid Robot Control System

This capstone project integrates all concepts from the three chapters to create a complete humanoid robot control system that demonstrates the full ROS 2 robotics stack.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll create a complete humanoid robot control system that includes:
- A ROS 2-based architecture with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python-based AI agents for decision making and control
- A URDF model for a humanoid robot
- Integration of perception, decision-making, and actuation

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:
- Integrate all three core ROS 2 concepts into a single application
- Design and implement a complete robotic system architecture
- Connect AI decision-making with robot control and modeling
- Validate and test a complete robotic system

## Project Components

### 1. Robot Model (URDF)
Create a humanoid robot model with:
- Head, torso, arms, and legs
- Proper joint constraints and limits
- Visual and collision properties
- Physical inertial properties

### 2. ROS 2 Architecture
Implement a distributed system with:
- Sensor nodes publishing data (camera, IMU, joint states)
- Control nodes processing AI decisions
- Action servers for complex behaviors
- Service interfaces for configuration

### 3. AI Control System
Develop Python-based AI agents that:
- Process sensor data from ROS 2 topics
- Make decisions based on environment state
- Send control commands to robot actuators
- Handle complex behaviors using actions

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up the robot model and simulation environment
2. Implement the ROS 2 communication architecture
3. Create the AI decision-making system
4. Integrate all components
5. Test and validate the complete system

## Success Criteria

Your system should successfully demonstrate:
- Proper communication between all ROS 2 nodes
- AI-based decision making based on sensor input
- Correct robot model visualization and control
- Integration of all three core concepts
