# Cross-Chapter Integration Exercises

This section provides hands-on exercises that combine concepts from all three chapters to create integrated robotic systems.

## Exercise 1: Perception-Action Loop

### Objective
Create a complete perception-action loop that combines ROS 2 concepts, Python AI integration, and robot modeling.

### Scenario
Design a simple robot controller that:
1. Uses sensor data (topics) from a simulated robot
2. Processes the data using Python-based decision making
3. Controls a humanoid robot model based on the decisions
4. Demonstrates proper ROS 2 architecture

### Steps
1. Create a sensor data publisher (Chapter 1 concepts)
2. Create a Python-based decision node (Chapter 2 concepts)
3. Design control commands for a URDF robot model (Chapter 3 concepts)
4. Integrate all components using proper ROS 2 communication patterns

## Exercise 2: Multi-Agent Coordination

### Objective
Build a system with multiple coordinated agents that integrate all three core concepts.

### Scenario
Design a system with:
- Multiple robot models (URDF from Chapter 3)
- Coordinated behavior using ROS 2 communication (Chapter 1)
- AI-based coordination logic (Chapter 2)

### Steps
1. Define multiple robot models in URDF
2. Create ROS 2 nodes for inter-robot communication
3. Implement AI coordination algorithms in Python
4. Test the integrated system

## Exercise 3: Complex Behavior Implementation

### Objective
Implement a complex behavior that requires all three core competencies.

### Scenario
Create a behavior such as:
- Object manipulation with a humanoid robot
- Navigation with obstacle avoidance
- Multi-sensory integration for decision making

### Steps
1. Model the robot and environment (URDF)
2. Set up sensor and actuator interfaces (ROS 2)
3. Implement the behavior using AI algorithms (Python)
4. Test the complete integrated system
