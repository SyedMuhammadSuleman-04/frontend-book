# Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim

This chapter introduces you to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation environment for robotics development. Isaac Sim provides photorealistic simulation capabilities using USD (Universal Scene Description) scenes and PhysX physics engine, making it ideal for generating synthetic data for training humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll learn how to:
- Set up and configure Isaac Sim environment
- Create photorealistic simulation scenes using USD
- Configure physics properties for realistic robot simulation
- Add and configure sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU) on humanoid robots
- Generate synthetic sensor data for training perception algorithms
- Validate synthetic data quality against real-world characteristics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- NVIDIA RTX graphics card (recommended RTX 3070 or higher with 8GB+ VRAM)
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or Windows 10/11 with Isaac Sim installed
- Basic knowledge of robot simulation concepts

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. [Photorealistic Simulation](./photorealistic-simulation.md) - Learn about USD scenes and PhysX physics
2. [Synthetic Data Generation](./synthetic-data-generation.md) - Master RTX rendering and data annotation
3. [Exercises](./exercises.md) - Hands-on tasks to practice your skills

Let's begin by exploring the photorealistic simulation capabilities of Isaac Sim.
