# Chapter Template

Use this template as a starting point for creating new chapters in the Isaac AI Brain module.

## Structure

Each chapter should follow this structure:

### index.md (Main Chapter Page)
- Chapter overview and learning objectives
- Prerequisites for the chapter
- Brief introduction to key concepts
- Navigation to sub-topics within the chapter

### Topic-specific files (e.g., perception-pipelines.md)
- Detailed explanation of specific concepts
- Code examples and implementation details
- Best practices and troubleshooting tips
- Integration with other components

### exercises.md
- Hands-on exercises to practice concepts
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected outcomes and solutions
- Challenge exercises for advanced learners

## Formatting Standards

### Headers
- Use proper heading hierarchy (##, ###, ####)
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

### Code Examples
- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Include comments explaining key parts
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### Links
- Use relative links between internal pages
- Include descriptive link text
- Verify all external links are valid

## Best Practices

1. **Educational Focus**: Write for the target audience (AI and robotics students)
2. **Practical Examples**: Include hands-on examples and exercises
3. **Integration**: Connect concepts to previous and future chapters
4. **Validation**: Include methods to verify understanding
5. **Accessibility**: Use clear language and provide visual aids where helpful
