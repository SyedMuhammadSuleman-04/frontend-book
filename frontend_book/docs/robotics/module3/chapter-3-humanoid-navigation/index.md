# Chapter 3: Humanoid Navigation with Nav2

This chapter focuses on implementing navigation for humanoid robots using the ROS 2 Navigation (Nav2) system. We'll explore how to adapt Nav2 for bipedal locomotion, considering balance and stability constraints that are unique to humanoid robots.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll learn how to:
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation
- Implement custom controllers for bipedal movement
- Plan paths that account for balance and gait constraints
- Handle obstacle avoidance for humanoid-specific locomotion
- Integrate perception data for safe navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapters 1 and 2 (Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS)
- Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot
- Isaac ROS perception pipelines working
- Basic understanding of Nav2 concepts (costmaps, planners, controllers)
- Python programming skills for ROS 2

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. [Nav2 Path Planning](./nav2-path-planning.md) - Learn about custom controllers for bipedal movement
2. [Bipedal Movement](./bipedal-movement.md) - Master gait planning and balance control
3. [Exercises](./exercises.md) - Hands-on tasks to practice your skills

Let's begin by exploring how to adapt Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation.
