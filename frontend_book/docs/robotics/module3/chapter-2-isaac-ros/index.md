# Chapter 2: Isaac ROS

This chapter focuses on Isaac ROS, NVIDIA's collection of hardware-accelerated perception and navigation packages that run on top of ROS 2. Isaac ROS leverages NVIDIA GPUs to provide real-time performance for complex perception tasks like VSLAM, object detection, and sensor fusion.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll learn how to:
- Install and configure Isaac ROS packages
- Implement hardware-accelerated VSLAM pipelines
- Create perception pipelines for object detection and tracking
- Bridge sensor data between Isaac Sim and ROS 2
- Optimize perception algorithms for real-time performance

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:
- Completed Chapter 1 (Isaac Sim Environment Setup)
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed and operational
- Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot model
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, parameters)
- Python programming skills

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into the following sections:
1. [VSLAM Pipelines](./vs-lam-pipelines.md) - Learn about hardware-accelerated VSLAM
2. [Perception Pipelines](./perception-pipelines.md) - Master object detection and sensor fusion
3. [Exercises](./exercises.md) - Hands-on tasks to practice your skills

Let's begin by exploring the hardware-accelerated VSLAM capabilities of Isaac ROS.
