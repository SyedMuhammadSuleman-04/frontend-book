# Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation

This chapter covers the implementation and use of simulated sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs. You'll learn how to configure these sensors to provide realistic sensor data for humanoid robot perception and control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Configure simulated LiDAR sensors on humanoid robot models
- Set up depth cameras and IMU sensors for realistic data generation
- Validate sensor data against expected real-world behavior patterns
- Integrate sensor data with ROS 2 topics and messages
- Implement perception pipelines using simulated sensor data

## Topics Covered

1. [LiDAR, Camera, and IMU Simulation](./lidar-camera-imu.md) - Understanding different sensor types and their simulation
2. [ROS 2 Integration](./ros2-integration.md) - Connecting sensor data with ROS 2 systems
3. [Hands-on Exercises](./exercises.md) - Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- Completed Chapters 1 and 2
- Gazebo and Unity properly set up
- Understanding of ROS 2 message types
- Basic knowledge of sensor data formats

## Why This Chapter is Important

Sensor simulation is critical for robot perception systems. Realistic sensor data enables robots to develop perception capabilities that can transfer to real-world applications. This chapter ties together the physics simulation and virtual environments with realistic sensor feedback.

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you should be able to configure simulated sensors on a humanoid robot model and verify that the sensor data matches expected real-world behavior patterns and data formats.
