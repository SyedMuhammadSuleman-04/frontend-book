# Chapter 1: Simulation Fundamentals

This chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of physics-based simulation using Gazebo. You'll learn about the core concepts of simulation including physics, gravity, and collision handling that form the foundation for realistic humanoid robot simulations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of physics simulation in Gazebo
- Configure gravity and friction parameters for realistic robot behavior
- Implement collision detection and response mechanisms
- Create simple robot models and test their physical interactions
- Validate simulation results against expected physical behaviors

## Topics Covered

1. [Physics Concepts in Gazebo](./physics-concepts.md) - Understanding the physics engine and its parameters
2. [Gravity and Collisions](./gravity-collisions.md) - How gravity affects robot behavior and collision handling
3. [Hands-on Exercises](./exercises.md) - Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Gazebo Garden installed
- Basic understanding of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Why This Chapter is Important

Understanding simulation fundamentals is crucial as it provides the foundation for all subsequent work in digital twin simulation. Without proper physics simulation, robot behaviors will not be realistic, making it difficult to transfer learned skills to real-world applications.

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you should be able to create a simple humanoid robot model in Gazebo and observe realistic physics-based behaviors including proper gravity effects and collision responses when the robot interacts with objects in the environment.
