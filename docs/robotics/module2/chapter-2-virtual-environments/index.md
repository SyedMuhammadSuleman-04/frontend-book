# Chapter 2: Virtual Environments

This chapter focuses on creating and interacting with virtual environments using Unity. You'll learn how to build realistic training scenarios for humanoid robots by creating complex environments with multiple objects, lighting conditions, and interactive elements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Set up Unity for robotics simulation with ROS 2 integration
- Create complex virtual environments with various objects and lighting
- Implement interactive elements that respond to robot interactions
- Connect Unity environments with ROS 2 simulation systems
- Validate that environments provide realistic visual feedback for robot sensors

## Topics Covered

1. [Unity Setup and ROS 2 Integration](./unity-setup.md) - Installing and configuring Unity for robotics
2. [Environment Building](./environment-building.md) - Creating virtual environments with objects and lighting
3. [Hands-on Exercises](./exercises.md) - Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, ensure you have:

- Unity 2022.3 LTS Personal Edition installed
- Completed Chapter 1 (Simulation Fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of Unity interface and tools
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed

## Why This Chapter is Important

Virtual environments are crucial for robot training as they provide diverse scenarios to test robot capabilities without the constraints of physical environments. Well-designed environments enable safe testing of robot behaviors and sensor responses.

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, you should be able to create a complex virtual environment in Unity with multiple objects, lighting conditions, and interactive elements that respond appropriately to robot interactions.
