# Robotics Module Overview

Welcome to the Robotics module, the first part of our comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of robotics using ROS 2 as the middleware for humanoid robot control.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts** - Understanding the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2: nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **Chapter 2: Python-ROS Integration** - Connecting Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 using rclpy
3. **Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling** - Creating and understanding robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 and its role as middleware in robotics
- Be able to create and connect ROS 2 nodes for robot communication
- Integrate Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 systems
- Model humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control
- Apply these concepts to practical robotics scenarios

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer capable of running ROS 2 (or a cloud-based ROS 2 environment)

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to learn about the fundamental concepts of ROS 2. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for the best learning experience.
