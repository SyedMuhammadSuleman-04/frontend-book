# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Core Concepts

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, and actions. These concepts form the backbone of the Robot Operating System and are essential for understanding how robotic systems communicate and coordinate.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of each ROS 2 communication pattern
- Create and run basic ROS 2 examples
- Understand the differences between topics, services, and actions
- Design simple robotic systems using ROS 2 concepts

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

- [Services and Actions](./services-actions.md)
- [Hands-on Exercises](./exercises.md)

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an actual operating system, but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

ROS 2 is designed to support the development of complex robots that need to integrate multiple sensors, actuators, and complex control algorithms. It provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 and to support the development of commercial robotics applications. Key improvements include:

- **Real-time support**: ROS 2 is designed to support real-time operation.
- **Multi-robot systems**: ROS 2 provides better support for multi-robot systems.
- **Security**: ROS 2 includes security features from the ground up.
- **Distributed system support**: ROS 2 is designed to support distributed systems.
- **Professional support**: ROS 2 is designed to support commercial applications.

Let's dive into the core concepts that make ROS 2 powerful for robotics applications.
